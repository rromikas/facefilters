# Glasses Virtual Try-on



With this JavaScript widget, you can offer glasses virtual try on to your users. It can be easily integrated on a website or in a mobile web application with a few lines of HTML code.The experience is in real-time: the user see his face like in a mirror, but with glasses on.


## Features
These are the main features of this widget :

* real-time webcam glasses virtual try on,
* light reconstruction (ambient + directionnal),
* very robust to all lighting conditions,
* mobile friendly,
* high end 3D engine with :
  * physically based rendering (PBR),
  * raytraced shadows,
  * deferred shading,
  * temporal antialiasing.



## Demonstration

You can test it with these demos :
* [Simple integration demo (demo.html of this repository)](https://jeeliz.com/demos/jeelizWidgetGitPublicDemo)
* [Jeeliz sunglasses application (not included in this repository)](https://jeeliz.com/sunglasses)

Here is a video screenshot of the Jeeliz Sunglasses application :

</p>

## Fallback
A Fallback version was available til January 2020. The server side webservice generating the rendering has been undeployed.
So now, if the user does not want to share its camera or if its implementation of WebGL is too minimalistic, a `FALLBACKUNAVAILABLE` error will be triggered.


## About the technology
### Documentation
This API uses Jeeliz WebGL Deep Learning technology to detect and track the user's face using a neural network.
You can find the technical documentation in [doc.pdf](/doc.pdf).

We have written some articles to help you for integration:

* [How to use the Jeeliz VTO widget in your everyday projects](https://jeeliz.com/blog/how-to-use-the-jeeliz-vto-widget-in-your-everyday-projects/)
* [Advanced use of the Jeeliz Widget VTO API](https://jeeliz.com/blog/advanced-use-of-the-jeeliz-widget-vto-api/)
* [Create a VTO experience from start to sale](https://jeeliz.com/blog/create-a-glasses-vto-experience-from-start-to-sale-with-the-jeeliz-glasses-vto-widget/)

If you still need more help, we also offer development services. You can contact-us [here](https://jeeliz.com/contact-us/).




### Compatibility
* If `WebGL2` is available, it uses `WebGL2` and no specific extension is required,
* If `WebGL2` is not available but `WebGL1`, we require either `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` extension or `OES_TEXTURE_HALF_FLOAT` extension,
* If `WebGL2` is not available, and if `WebGL1` is not available or neither `OES_TEXTURE_FLOAT` or `OES_HALF_TEXTURE_FLOAT` are implemented, the user is not compatible with the real time video version.

In all cases, WebRTC should be implemented in the web browser, otherwise FaceFilter API will not be able to get the webcam video feed. Here are the compatibility tables from [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) here: [WebGL1](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl), [WebGL2](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl2), [WebRTC](https://caniuse.com/#feat=stream).

If a compatibility error is triggered, please post an issue on this repository. If this is a problem with the webcam access, please first retry after closing all applications which could use your device (Skype, Messenger, other browser tabs and windows, ...). Please include :
* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL1](http://webglreport.com/?v=1) (about your `WebGL1` implementation),
* a screenshot of [webglreport.com - WebGL2](http://webglreport.com/?v=2) (about your `WebGL2` implementation),
* the log from the web console,
* the steps to reproduce the bug, and screenshots.



## Hosting
### HTTPS only !
This widget requires the user's webcam video stream through `MediaStream API`. So your application should be hosted by a HTTPS server (even with a self-signed certificate). It won't work at all with unsecure HTTP, even locally with some web browsers.


### The scripts
You can use our hosted and up to date version of the library, available here :
```
https://appstatic.jeeliz.com/jeewidget/JeelizNNCwidget.js
```
which fetches the neuron network hosted here :
```
https://appstatic.jeeliz.com/jeefit/built/jeefitNNC.json
```
They are hosted in a content delivery network (CDN) using gzip compression. The script file is the same than `release/JeelizNNCwidget.js`.


### Glasses 3D models and materials
Glasses models and materials are stored on the *Jeeliz GlassesDB*. Each model is designed by a unique SKU. You can check the different models available by opening [glassesSKU.csv](/glassesSKU.csv) file. If you want us to add specific glasses models, please contact us at `contact__at__jeeliz.com` or [here](https://jeeliz.com/contact-us/).

So this library is not fully client side because the assets are hosted by our servers. If you want to manage your own assets you can use our generalistic face detection and tracking API, [Jeeliz FaceFilter API](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter). There is a demonstration included in that repository, using THREE.JS as 3D rendering engine, which can be a starting point, [Miel Pops Glasses](https://jeeliz.com/demos/faceFilter/demos/threejs/miel_pops/).

Of course we do not expect a large link to Jeeliz over your face filter, but if you can put the link in the credits/about/help/footer section it would be great.



## See also
Jeeliz main face detection and tracking library is called [Jeeliz FaceFilter API](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizFaceFilter). It handles multi-face detection, and for each tracked face it provides the rotation angles and the mouth opening factor. It is perfect to build your own Snapchat/MSQRD like face filters running in the browser. It comes with dozen of integration demo, including a face swap.
